Boss: YOU! (he yells)
Past Bob: *shudders*
Boss: I know what you did.
Past Bob: Did what? I don’t believe I did anything wrong?
Boss: Don’t get all stupid on me, I know you were the one who messed up putting up that foundation!
Past Bob: I s-swear I don’t know what you were talking about.
Past Bob: Did you talk to Steve about it? He was working with me on foundations.
Boss: Yes I did, he told me that he saw you looking drunk all day.
Boss: He also told me that you made him do all the dirty work!
Past Bob: I’m so confused, I’m pretty sure if I laid the foundation wrong, I would’ve noticed it pretty quickly.
Past Bob: I rarely drink, and even if I did, I wouldn’t drink right before work. 
Past Bob: Are you sure that Steve didn’t do it?
Boss: Why wouldn’t I believe Steve? Steve has always treated me with respect, UNLIKE YOU.
Boss: YOU never get me coffee, you never offer to buy ME lunch, and you ALWAYS groan when I have you work extra hours.
Boss: Shouldn’t you be happy that you’re working extra hours? I know you have a lot of debt to pay off.
Boss: Matter of fact, if you don’t take full responsibility for this and apologize, I’ll cut your pay to minimum wage and all your overtime will be unpaid.
Past Bob: I swear I didn’t mess it up, please just believe me.
Boss: You wanna play that game? Fine, your pay is cut, and now this project will take an extra month to finish because of your stupid mistake. I hope you’re happy.
Player Bob: This happened 2 weeks ago.
Player Bob: I remember when I got home from work that day, I felt extremely miserable.
Player Bob: I’ve been extremely careful with how I spend my money ever since.
Player Bob: I still had to buy my coworkers lunch. 
Player Bob: Lately, it's been so bad I've been scared that my landlord will kick me out.
Player Bob: I’ve been thinking of working another job to keep things afloat, but would I be able to handle working 2 jobs? The future is scary.
