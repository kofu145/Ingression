Phone: Ring, ring, ring!
Friend: Hey Bob, how’s it going!
Past Bob: It’s going good, I finally got off from work! They keep putting me on overtime!
Friend: Aw, sorry to hear that.
Friend: Anyway, I’m calling to let you know that I got a new job at a huge company!
Past Bob: No way, really? Congrats!
Friend: Thanks! My family has to move to the city soon for my new job, which is sad, but the kids are happy since I promised them I’d get them a puppy if I got this job.
Friend: The pay and the benefits are really good! I might finally be able to pay off my college debt, haha! 
Friend: My wife’s been thinking of being a stay-at-home mom to take care of the kids and our new puppy, since I’ll be the breadwinner of the household.
Past Bob: Oh, really? That’s so nice, I’m happy for you!
Player Bob: I remember as soon as he said how good his life was turning out to be, I had a weird feeling in my chest.
Player Bob: Why couldn’t that be me?
Player Bob: Why couldn’t I live comfortably in life with a job that treats me nice?
Player Bob: Why couldn’t I live in peace, knowing that I’ll always have enough money for housing and food?
Player Bob: Why don’t I deserve good things to happen to me for once in my life?
