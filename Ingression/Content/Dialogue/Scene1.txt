Bob: What is this? Is this... a memory?
Co-worker 1: Hey Steve, did you watch the game last night? I was shaking the whole time!
Co-worker 2: Yeah, I did. Me and the kids were going crazy! Thankfully our Bulldogs pulled through!
Co-worker 3: No kidding! Next game, we should all watch at-
Past Bob: Good morning guys, how are you all doing?
Co-worker 1: Oh, it’s you.
Co-worker 2: You know the drill, buy us lunch.
Past Bob: Will you guys ever give me enough money to pay for everything? 
Past Bob: This isn’t even enough money to cover for one person’s lunch. I’ve been running low on cash to make up for it.
Co-worker 3: Nope. Not even the boss likes you, so don’t waste your time tattling on us, he wouldn’t even believe you!
Everyone: *Laughs*
Player Bob: Was I always treated this way? What did I do to make them treat me like that?
